# Quotem

Quote 'em! Even in your minimalist setup you need quotes shown on your desktop to continue your journey towards minimalism and excellence! (At least I do ...) \
So here's my tiny Conky-setup for exactly that. It works with tiling window managers, not being focusable and close to no memory/CPU footprint.

## Installation

- Obviously you will need Conky.
- Move the conky.conv to your ```.config``` directory.
- Maintain a file of your favorite quotes in ```~/.local/share/quotes/quotes.txt```.

## The quotes.txt-file

Each line is a quote.
Newlines are added with a Markdown-like ```\```.
Quotes are to be put into quotation marks.
The author follows right after.
See the following example:
```
"Kids, you tried your best and failed miserably. The lesson is never try!"Homer J. Simpson
```
